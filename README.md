# MedVision
**All-in-One Medical Imaging & PACS Platform**

MedVision is a modular medical imaging system built from the ground up to study
DICOM internals, medical image processing, and PACS communication using C++ on Windows.

This project focuses on understanding how medical imaging systems work internally
rather than building a clinical-grade product.

## Key Objectives
- Implement DICOM reader/writer
- Build a medical image rendering pipeline
- Support basic PACS communication (C-FIND, C-MOVE, C-STORE)
- Explore 2D and introductory 3D medical imaging
- Design scalable desktop architecture

## Technology Stack
- C/C++
- OpenCV (image processing)
- DCMTK (reference / comparison)
- Win32 / WPF
- Visual Studio 2022+
